title: New website!

I've started working on setting up my own website to post projects and things to. I do have a list of things I would like to accomplish, such as:

- [ ] Repository table and links
- [ ] Image background for main page
- [ ] Client side dark mode toggle??

Hopefully I can complete these within the next few days.

I also really have to start editing this client side and pushing groups of changes, the commit log is going to get huge if I don't.
